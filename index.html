                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <br>
                <p>I am an aspiring web developer from Minnesota. I have been playing board games
                    since the early 2000's. But I became a serious hobby gamer around 2017. I enjoy
                    all sorts of differnt games, from welcoming games to heavy strategy.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>I created this site to combine my two passions: board gaming and programming. I play
                    a lot of solo variants of games, so I often find that a digital deck can save a lot
                    of time. Which means I get to play more!
